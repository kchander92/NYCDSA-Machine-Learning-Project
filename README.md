This is my NYCDSA machine learning project on developing and analyzing predictive and descriptive machine learning models that estimate the sale prices for houses built in Ames, Iowa in or before 2010 based on [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). The models are built in a Python environment using Jupyter Notebook and utilize the packages Pandas and Scikit-Learn for data processing and for building the machine learning models respectively. My blog post can be found here (will update once published).
